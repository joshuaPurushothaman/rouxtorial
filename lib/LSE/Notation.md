# Move notation:
- https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/advanced/ is a nice reference!
- R,L,U,D,F,B as usual for side turns
- For slice turns:
  - M move: Follows the L side, turns the middle slice. M' goes "*up*"
  - E move: follows D -> E is a "swipe from left to right"
  - S is rarely used lol
- I often use U* to describe "some U-layer move", but whether it's U, U', or U2 is situational.


## Describing edge positions:
- UF, UB, UL, UR, DF, DB
  - **U**p/**D**own 
  <!-- - that line above looks awful without the preview LOL -->
  - **F**ront/**B**ack
  - **L**eft/**R**ight
- The "bottom two" are DF and DB
- The "left and right on top" are UL and UR (aka ULUR in step 2, later on)
