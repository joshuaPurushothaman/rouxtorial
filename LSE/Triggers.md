- "Flip": `M' U M`:
  - Flips the "arrow case" of edges, where there are 3 good on top in front, and 1 on bottom front.
  - `M U M'` Same thing, but mirrored for the back side
  - Technically, it's just `M* U* M*`, but none are M2 nor U2.
    - An "M*" here just means either M' or M, whatever works for the situation.
- "Swap": `M' U2 M`
  - Swaps the top front edge with the bottom.
  - `M U2 M'`: mirrored for back side
